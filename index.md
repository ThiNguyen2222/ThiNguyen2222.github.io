### CPSC 120

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-iliana-and-thi)
Lab 12, part 1 was my favorite lab I did and it was the perfect final lab. It was relatively simple, yet it applied mathematical concepts such as the usage of sine. It is great to use skills beyond coding itself, and shows the importance of studying math in this field.

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-thi-and-donathew)
Overall, I enjoyed doing the entirety of lab 8. It was the first lab we did that accessed files, so it opened up a bunch of possibilities we could do with our code. I especially liked the little animations we were able to run from part 3.

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-juan-and-partner)
Lab 7, part 1 is one of my favorites due to its difficulty as a beginner coder. It was the first time we used functions, so I was a bit confused on the concept. However, after going through the parts with my partner, I slowly understood and came to realize how functions made everything easier to code with.
